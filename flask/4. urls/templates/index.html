    <p>Flask detects the local file changes, but won't push the changes to your browser. Flask and the browser are fully de-coupled, Flask just stands there and waits for requests, it only responds if it receives a request. After return 'Hello', the connection between the browser and Flask is going to be disconnected.</p>
